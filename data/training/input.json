However, they also raise ethical issues and challenges that researchers need to consider carefully before deciding whether to offer them or not. This document aims to provide some guidance and tips for researchers on this topic, based on the principles of respect, beneficence, justice and integrity. Respect : Researchers should respect the autonomy and dignity of participants, and avoid any undue influence or coercion that may compromise their voluntary consent. Payments and incentives should not be so high that they create an irresistible temptation for participants to join or stay in a study, or so low that they exploit their vulnerability or need. Researchers should also consider the cultural and social context of the participants, and how payments and incentives may affect their expectations, motivations and relationships. Beneficence : Researchers should maximise the benefits and minimise the harms of their research, both for the participants and for the society. Payments and incentives should not compromise the scientific validity or quality of the research, or introduce any bias or conflict of interest. Researchers should also ensure that payments and incentives are fair and proportional to the time, effort and inconvenience involved in participating, and that they do not create any undue burden or risk for the participants. Justice : Researchers should ensure that payments and incentives are distributed equitably and transparently among the participants, and that they do not create or reinforce any social or economic inequalities or injustices. Researchers should also avoid any discrimination or exploitation of vulnerable or marginalised groups, such as children, minorities, refugees, prisoners, etc. Researchers should also respect the rights and interests of the communities or populations from which the participants are drawn, and ensure that they share the benefits of the research. Integrity : Researchers should conduct their research with honesty, accountability and professionalism, and adhere to the ethical standards and codes of conduct of their discipline and institution. Payments and incentives should not compromise the integrity of the researchers or the participants, or undermine the trust and credibility of the research. Researchers should also disclose any payments and incentives to the relevant authorities, such as ethics committees, funders, publishers, etc., and obtain their approval if required. **The following are questions that a researcher should consider before using payments or in their research: *Microsoft Bing CoPilot generated response from the following prompt: \u201cProduce a guidance document for researchers that outlines issues and considerations on the topic of payments and incentives for participants. It should provide both an overview of the ethical problem and provide pragmatic solutions and tips for the researcher prior to deciding whether payment or incentive is appropriate or necessary.\u201d **Microsoft Bing CoPilot generated response from the following prompt: \u201cProvide four questions that a researcher should consider before using payments or incentives, in the form of tangible rewards (e.g. vouchers), in their research to recruit participants.\u201d \u00a9 2024 Copyright University of Gloucestershire Company Registration Number 06023243.

Apprenticeships allow people to earn qualifications whilst working (they must work at least 30 hours per week). They are a fantastic and\u00a0cost-effective\u00a0way for employers to upskill their workforce. Research shows that companies that invest in apprenticeships benefit from greater productivity , enhanced competitiveness and improved staff retention . Higher and degree apprenticeships result in qualifications at level 4 (the equivalent of the first year of an undergraduate degree) and above. At University of Gloucestershire, we offer programmes up to level 7 (Master\u2019s level). Whatever level of study, apprentices gain academic, professional and technical skills through a mix of learning in the workplace, formal off-the-job training, and by practising their new skills in the workplace. Information for learners (https://www.glos.ac.uk/study/apprenticeships-information-for-learners/) For employers, it is crucial that they commit to employing the apprentice throughout their training, End Point Assessment, and beyond. Apprentices should be motivated to learn and work diligently to successfully complete their apprenticeship. The training provider, in this case, University of Gloucestershire, is responsible for delivering the theoretical content, known as the knowledge award. With so many options now available, more people than ever are eligible for an apprenticeship. Find out which of your employees are eligible by answering the questions below. If you have answered \u2018yes\u2019 to all the above, then the person you have in mind is eligible. The next step is to contact us (#contact) so we can put everything in place for the application. If you have answered \u2018no\u2019 to some of the above, please contact us (#contact) so we can discuss further options. Importantly, an individual cannot apply for a degree apprenticeship directly\u00a0(like you would for a traditional undergraduate degree). If you are interested in undertaking an apprenticeship yourself, speak to your employer in the first instance and make them aware of why an apprenticeship is a worthwhile investment. Information for learners (https://www.glos.ac.uk/study/apprenticeships-information-for-learners/) Find out how apprenticeships are funded by the Apprenticeships Levy and how we will support you. To meet funding requirements, every apprentice must spend at least 6 hours a week of their contracted working hours doing \u2018off-the-job\u2019 training. It is an essential part of any apprenticeship and must take place during a learner\u2019s working hours. These 6 hours should be organised within the apprentice\u2019s working time in a way that best supports both their learning needs and the needs of their employer. If, due to some exceptional circumstances, it has to take place outside the learner\u2019s normal working hours (e.g. they need to attend a particular event), then they must be given time off in lieu. The off-the-job element of an apprenticeship can be described as an activity where the learner is not undertaking their \u2018normal\u2019 work activity. Compliance with this \u20186 hours off-the-job\u2019 rule must be evidenced as part of normal audit arrangements. As such, both apprentices and employers need to keep detailed and timely records of off-the-job activities. If you have any questions or want to speak to a member of the team you can email, call us or fill in the form below. \u00a9 2024 Copyright University of Gloucestershire Company Registration Number 06023243.

The following information provides information on the additional funding available for full-time students who will start an Allied Health course in September 2024 or January 2025 and who ordinarily live in the UK and will be studying in England. Student Loans, Dependants\u2019 Grants and Disabled Students\u2019 Allowances (DSA) are available from Student Finance England* for each academic year to help towards living costs and to cover the cost of the Tuition Fees. Please click on the undergraduate link for more information. *Loans and Grants from other UK regions will vary. View information for Student Finance Wales (https://www.studentfinancewales.co.uk/) , Student Awards Agency Scotland (https://www.saas.gov.uk/) and Student Finance Northern Ireland (https://www.studentfinanceni.co.uk/) Undergraduate Healthcare courses at University of Gloucestershire include: Please note that the 2-year MSc in Physiotherapy attracts the same funding each year from Student Finance England as the BSc (Hons) Physiotherapy.\u00a0Please click on the link for undergraduate link for more information.\u00a0Please note that students from other UK regions should apply for the Postgraduate Loan offered by their funding body. The BSc (Hons) Nursing courses; Physiotherapy; Diagnostic Radiotherapy, Occupational Therapy and Operating Department Practice courses are all classed as exceptions to the previous study rule. This means you are eligible to apply for full funding from Student Finance England for these courses as a second degree providing you are not already registered in the same discipline.\u00a0For example: if you hold an Adult Nursing degree you will be eligible for funding if you want to start a Nursing degree in Mental Health. *Unfortunately, this is not the case for the BSc (Hons)  Paramedic Science course. If you have previously studied at level 4 or above this will affect your eligibility for funding for a new course. If you are not eligible for Student Finance due to previous study, Paramedic Science students may still qualify for the Training Grant of \u00a35,000 from the Learning Support Fund in the NHS.\u00a0Applications will be assessed on a case-by-case basis.\u00a0You will need to apply to Student Finance England in the first instance so they can confirm eligibility with a zero entitlement before you can register and apply for the Training Grant as per the instructions below. ** Social Work as a second degree attracts the Maintenance Loan and Dependants\u2019 Grants (if relevant) but NOT the Tuition Fee Loan.\u00a0Tuition Fees can be paid to the university in 8 monthly direct debit instalments in each academic year.  Students can either apply for the Postgraduate Loan from Student Finance England (\u00a312,471 per course \u2013 not per year); or apply for the Social Work Bursary. Please note that Undergraduate Social Work students are not eligible for the NHS Social Work Bursary in the first year of the course. Eligibility for this bursary from the second year of the course will also depend on the number of bursaries allocated to the University. Please contact us for more information. A non-repayable Training Grant of \u00a35,000 from the LSF is available per academic year for Nursing and many other Allied Healthcare courses. Additional payments worth up to a total of \u00a31,000 per academic year for specialisms such as Mental Health; Learning Disability and Diagnostic Radiography.\u00a0A regional incentive of \u00a31,000 will also be available for specialist courses in certain regions.\u00a0Please note that these payments will automatically be added to your account when you select a qualifying course and University when you apply for the Training Grant. The Training Grant and additional payments if relevant will be paid directly in to your bank account in 3 equal instalments in each academic year \u2013 one instalment is paid in each term. To be eligible for the Training Grant and other LSF incentives you must be eligible for both the  Maintenance Loan and the Tuition Fee Loan from Student Finance, even if you decide not to apply for these loans.\u00a0However, you will need to apply to Student Finance but you can select a specific loan amount or enter zero. You have to upload the Notification of Entitlement from Student Finance in to your LSF account when you apply for the Training Grant. You will need to apply every year for funding from Student Finance prior to applying for the Training Grant and other incentives from the LSF. Please note that the Training Grant and other LSF incentives are NOT available to students who only qualify for the Tuition Fee loan.

Last updated: 4 December 2023 1.1 The University of Gloucestershire is a higher education establishment that employs approximately 1,500 staff members, teaches in the region of 9,000 students and purchases around \u00a325m per annum of goods, services and works through various supply chain arrangements. The University is registered as a company, no: 06023243. 1.2 The University is committed to employing staff, engaging with and supporting our students, acquiring goods, services and works for its requirements, and otherwise conducting its business without causing harm to others.\u00a0 In so doing, we are committed to supporting the UK Government\u2019s Action Plan (https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/236901/BHR_Action_Plan_-_final_online_version_1_.pdf) to implement the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. 1.3\u00a0\u00a0The University have a zero-tolerance policy in relation to modern slavery and human trafficking and is committed to continuing to work with the newly formed Gloucestershire Anti-Slavery Partnership to keep addressing areas of higher risk and concern. 2.1 This Statement is designed to satisfy the requirements of Part 6 of the Modern Slavery Act 2015, by informing our Members, students, staff, and other stakeholders about the University and its policy with respect to modern slavery, human trafficking, forced and bonded labour and labour rights violations in its supply chains. Direct employment of staff 3.1 The University and its subsidiaries mitigates the risk of the occurrence of modern slavery in its teams of directly employed staff through strict adherence to its robust HR recruitment and candidate selection policies. Additionally, the University has a whistle blowing policy through which staff can raise concerns. Employment of staff through recruitment agencies and other sources 3.2 Temporary staff and other staff recruited indirectly by the University are only recruited through established and accredited sources who can provide assurance that they fully comply with the requirements of all legislation relating to the rights and welfare of their candidates and employees. Students 3.3 Although the risks of students experiencing occurrences of modern slavery or human trafficking through direct contact with the University are extremely low it is appreciated that whilst living within Cheltenham and Gloucester and the surrounding area, they may become aware of such instances or on very rare occasions be entrapped into adopting the life style of a modern slave. In order to mitigate these circumstances, the University has in place easily accessible and well known channels through which students can obtain assistance, support and advice on their wellbeing. 3.4 Staff within the Student Services Department, as well as officers and staff members within the University\u2019s Students\u2019 Union, will receive training briefings on the issues related to modern slavery, and how students can be supported should they present with related concerns. Supply chain 3.5 The University\u2019s supply chain has been identified as the area of highest risk in terms of possible occurrences of modern slavery. In order to mitigate this the following action has been taken: 3.6 The University\u2019s procurement function is supported by a published and implemented Sustainability Strategy and Procurement Strategy to which we are fully committed. These strategies contain steps that form part of the supplier selection process and lead to ensuring that slavery and human trafficking are not taking place in the supply chain. 3.7 The University is a member of the Southern Universities Procurement Consortium (SUPC), which works with the other UK higher education procurement consortia to deliver and manage large joint purchasing, developmental and improvement projects for collaborative procurement within the sector.\u00a0 Together, the purchasing consortia have published a shared Sustainability Policy to which all member consortia are committed. This policy contains steps that form part of the supplier selection for the major contract procurement processes that are conducted for the consortium members, and supports ensuring that slavery and human trafficking are not taking place in the supply chain. 3.8 The following procurement categories have been identified as higher risk in terms of finding modern slavery and human trafficking occurrences in the supply chain: 3.9 When procuring goods, works and services in the higher risk categories the University ensures that suppliers are required to prove a high level of corporate social responsibility during the tendering and selection process. 4.1 As part of this reporting exercise in this and the coming years, The University of Gloucestershire expresses its commitment to better understanding its supply chains and working towards greater transparency and responsibility towards people working within them. 4.2 Since our last statement we have continued to monitor the supply chains which represent a medium to high risk of modern slavery, human trafficking, forced and bonded labour, and labour rights violations. We will continue to monitor these supply chains closely and take appropriate action if necessary. 4.3\u00a0Through the procurement category lead buyer initiative, the University has raised awareness of modern slavery and human trafficking considerations within specific procurement categories. These considerations have formed part of the supplier selection process for goods, works and services in these categories. 4.4\u00a0Our suppliers in the higher risk areas have been asked to commit to the Base Code (http://www.ethicaltrade.org/resources/eti-base-code) of the Ethical Trading Initiative (http://www.ethicaltrade.org/) (ETI) and are working to persuade all suppliers in these categories to support these initiatives.\u00a0 The ETI Base Code is founded on the conventions of the International Labour Organisation (ILO) and is an internationally recognised code of labour practice, requiring that: The Ethical Trading Initiative have issued guidance and news (https://www.ethicaltrade.org/issues/covid-19) relating to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic affects on ethics within the supply chain. The University has contacted the above-mentioned suppliers in order to bring this to their attention. 4.5\u00a0The University is an active member of The Gloucestershire Anti-Slavery Partnership (https://www.gloucestershire.gov.uk/health-and-social-care/gloucestershire-anti-slavery-partnership/#:~:text=The%20Gloucestershire%20Anti%20Slavery%20Partnership,modern%20slavery%20within%20the%20county.) and a number of our staff team members have received online updates aimed at raising awareness of the risks of modern slavery in the local community. The knowledge gained from this initiative has been cascaded to and shared with our front facing teams to support the effective delivery of their roles. 4.6\u00a0On 12 March 2021 the Home Office contacted all relevant organisations requiring them register on and publish their annual modern slavery statements to the new government modern slavery statement register by 9 April 2021. The University duly complied and our current statement can be viewed here (https://modern-slavery-statement-registry.service.gov.uk/statement-summary/Cdd1Zzae/2024) . 4.7 The University\u2019s \u2018Modern Slavery and Human Trafficking Guidance\u2019 centralised web page (https://connectglosac.sharepoint.com/sites/staffnet/FinancePlanning/procurement/Documents/Modern-Slavery.pdf) has been developed on the University\u2019s Staffnet and guides readers to a number of key sources of information relating to modern slavery and human trafficking. 4.8 This Statement has been approved and published by the University Council and will be reviewed at least once annually.

Find out more on our Information for parents and carers pages (https://www.glos.ac.uk/outreach/outreach-for-parents-and-carers/) UK data protection legislation and university policy prohibit the disclosure of an individual\u2019s information to a third party. This means that staff members at the university are unable to give any information about a student currently studying at the university to a third party. In this instance a third party would include parents, carers, family members, friends etc. All universities in the UK follow similar guidelines and are bound by the same legislation. Information that staff are not be able to share includes a student\u2019s academic progress, wellbeing, or attendance, for example. For this reason, we encourage parents and students to keep in regular contact regarding these and similar topics. In certain exceptional circumstances and with the student\u2019s written consent, we may communicate with a third party if the university deems it to be in the interests of those concerned. If you have concerns about your son or daughter, in the first instance you should encourage them to contact Student Services. If you are concerned about the wellbeing of your child or young person, you can make contact with the university by calling Student Services via our Helpzone Service on 01242 714444 or by email at helpzones@glos.ac.uk (mailto:helpzones@glos.ac.uk) . We will take details of the student in question, contact them on your behalf to let them know that you have contacted us, and ask them to get in touch with you. The onus will be on the student to contact the person who raised the original concern and staff will not generally get back in touch with them. While staff cannot talk to you about your child or young person, they are able to listen to your concerns and give generic advice and information where appropriate. If an emergency takes place on campus, appropriate staff will contact next of kin (without the student\u2019s permission), if it is deemed appropriate. This would normally be on the advice of emergency services. When enrolling each academic year, every student is required to submit their trusted contact, which will be held within the student records system. As part of this process, students will be made aware that by sharing these contact details that they are agreeing to the University making contact with their nominated trusted contact when there is an emergency situation related to their personal wellbeing. Students will be encouraged to inform the contact that they have been nominated, and that their details have been shared with the University. The University reserves the right to use the trusted contact without prior agreement when it is in the student\u2019s vital interest to do so (i.e. preventing serious or lasting harm to the student or others and it has not been possible to obtain their consent). Our Privacy Notice (https://www.glos.ac.uk/information/knowledge-base/student-privacy-notice/) contains further information on how we use the data. The university takes the pastoral care of students very seriously, but it does not have parental responsibility and can only offer support if approached by the student. In cases where the student is thought to be at risk, appropriate action will be taken by those concerned. Please note that this is rare. \u00a9 2024 Copyright University of Gloucestershire Company Registration Number 06023243. VAT Number GB 393 9083 56.",

In addition to building a sense of community within the university, we are supporting positive links with local communities. Our vision for equity, diversity and inclusion: \u201cTo create an inclusive University where everyone is treated fairly and with respect, where we feel valued and have a sense of belonging; a culture where it is safe to speak up and speak out and where we are empowered to grow and realise our full potential.\u201d \u201cBelonging\u201d, Our Equity, Diversity and Inclusion Strategy, 2022-27, encapsulates our focus on equity, diversity, and inclusion with ambitious objectives for change. It signals a deliberate move towards a fully integrated approach to equity, diversity, and inclusion where structures and systems are aligned, and inclusive behaviours are recognised and rewarded. It articulates a clear direction and vision for the university. Coming at a time of national and global spotlight on equity, diversity and inclusion generally, it is both relevant and important for University of Gloucestershire to strengthen its approach. You can read the full Strategy here (https://www.glos.ac.uk/information/knowledge-base/belonging-our-equity-diversity-and-inclusion-strategy-2022-2027) and a summary version in the link below.

It sets out how the University of Gloucestershire is creating a positive environment in which students and staff are valued for their diverse contributions and provided with development and progression opportunities to reach their full potential.\u200b\u200b If you have any comments or questions, please\u00a0contact Clare Peterson (mailto:cpeterson@glos.ac.uk) , Equality, Diversity and Inclusion Manager\u00a0or Anna Hay (mailto:ahay@glos.ac.uk) , Head of Student Wellbeing. Visit the Equality and Diversity blog (https://sites.glos.ac.uk/equality) and follow us on Instagram (https://www.instagram.com/uogequality/) We offer a range of support services for students: We also offer a range of support services for staff: Current staff can access further information on Staffnet (https://connectglosac.sharepoint.com/sites/staffnet/) (login required). Staff at University of Gloucestershire have access to a number of support networks. Our Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic + Network aims to provide a supportive and safe space for staff and students at University of Gloucestershire. It is a platform through which their views can be heard and recognised by the university. The Network is a source of information for new and existing students and employees. We aim to support members to access the services they need to thrive, such as mentoring, career advice and development opportunities, and to advocate for those who feel they have been discriminated against. The Women\u2019s Network offers a safe space to women across the university regardless of role. We aim to build and develop confidence and empower women within the institution, as well as ensuring women are represented in the university and their views shape the equality and diversity agenda. The network has regular events including socials, speakers and workshops on topical subjects of interest to the network, and celebrations of key events such as International Women\u2019s Day. The pride network was set up to ensure a shared, safe space for the LGBTQ+ community. This network includes those from the LGBTQ+ community and their allies. This network meets regularly and discusses a range of events and issues. The LGBTQ+ network aims to ensure that calendar events such as pride month and LGBTQ history month are celebrated. As part of our journey to create an inclusive culture, the University has established an employee neurodiversity group. Like our existing groups and networks, it is employe-driven and employee-led. At UoG, our approach to equality, diversity and inclusion is to embed and align it with business practice, recognising it can only be effective when it is co-created. Our employee groups support the evolution of our workforce culture, the achievement of our equity, diversity and inclusion goals and give a voice to this under-represented employee group. Working with employee groups provides the opportunity to create innovative solutions that are relevant, effective, and sustainable. This group is open to all staff, those who are neuro diverse, allies and those who want to educate themselves. We are keen to collect as much equality data as we can, enabling us to build a rich picture of both our students and staff. We make use of this data to improve student and staff experiences, to inform our equality impact assessments, to influence recruitment practices for students and staff and measure the impact and progress of our activities.

However, they also raise ethical issues and challenges that researchers need to consider carefully before deciding whether to offer them or not. This document aims to provide some guidance and tips for researchers on this topic, based on the principles of respect, beneficence, justice and integrity. Respect : Researchers should respect the autonomy and dignity of participants, and avoid any undue influence or coercion that may compromise their voluntary consent. Payments and incentives should not be so high that they create an irresistible temptation for participants to join or stay in a study, or so low that they exploit their vulnerability or need. Researchers should also consider the cultural and social context of the participants, and how payments and incentives may affect their expectations, motivations and relationships. Beneficence : Researchers should maximise the benefits and minimise the harms of their research, both for the participants and for the society. Payments and incentives should not compromise the scientific validity or quality of the research, or introduce any bias or conflict of interest. Researchers should also ensure that payments and incentives are fair and proportional to the time, effort and inconvenience involved in participating, and that they do not create any undue burden or risk for the participants. Justice : Researchers should ensure that payments and incentives are distributed equitably and transparently among the participants, and that they do not create or reinforce any social or economic inequalities or injustices. Researchers should also avoid any discrimination or exploitation of vulnerable or marginalised groups, such as children, minorities, refugees, prisoners, etc. Researchers should also respect the rights and interests of the communities or populations from which the participants are drawn, and ensure that they share the benefits of the research. Integrity : Researchers should conduct their research with honesty, accountability and professionalism, and adhere to the ethical standards and codes of conduct of their discipline and institution. Payments and incentives should not compromise the integrity of the researchers or the participants, or undermine the trust and credibility of the research. Researchers should also disclose any payments and incentives to the relevant authorities, such as ethics committees, funders, publishers, etc., and obtain their approval if required. **The following are questions that a researcher should consider before using payments or in their research: *Microsoft Bing CoPilot generated response from the following prompt: \u201cProduce a guidance document for researchers that outlines issues and considerations on the topic of payments and incentives for participants. It should provide both an overview of the ethical problem and provide pragmatic solutions and tips for the researcher prior to deciding whether payment or incentive is appropriate or necessary.\u201d **Microsoft Bing CoPilot generated response from the following prompt: \u201cProvide four questions that a researcher should consider before using payments or incentives, in the form of tangible rewards (e.g. vouchers), in their research to recruit participants.\u201d \u00a9 2024 Copyright University of Gloucestershire Company Registration Number 06023243.

However, they also raise ethical issues and challenges that researchers need to consider carefully before deciding whether to offer them or not. This document aims to provide some guidance and tips for researchers on this topic, based on the principles of respect, beneficence, justice and integrity. Respect : Researchers should respect the autonomy and dignity of participants, and avoid any undue influence or coercion that may compromise their voluntary consent. Payments and incentives should not be so high that they create an irresistible temptation for participants to join or stay in a study, or so low that they exploit their vulnerability or need. Researchers should also consider the cultural and social context of the participants, and how payments and incentives may affect their expectations, motivations and relationships. Beneficence : Researchers should maximise the benefits and minimise the harms of their research, both for the participants and for the society. Payments and incentives should not compromise the scientific validity or quality of the research, or introduce any bias or conflict of interest. Researchers should also ensure that payments and incentives are fair and proportional to the time, effort and inconvenience involved in participating, and that they do not create any undue burden or risk for the participants. Justice : Researchers should ensure that payments and incentives are distributed equitably and transparently among the participants, and that they do not create or reinforce any social or economic inequalities or injustices. Researchers should also avoid any discrimination or exploitation of vulnerable or marginalised groups, such as children, minorities, refugees, prisoners, etc. Researchers should also respect the rights and interests of the communities or populations from which the participants are drawn, and ensure that they share the benefits of the research. Integrity : Researchers should conduct their research with honesty, accountability and professionalism, and adhere to the ethical standards and codes of conduct of their discipline and institution. Payments and incentives should not compromise the integrity of the researchers or the participants, or undermine the trust and credibility of the research. Researchers should also disclose any payments and incentives to the relevant authorities, such as ethics committees, funders, publishers, etc., and obtain their approval if required. **The following are questions that a researcher should consider before using payments or in their research: *Microsoft Bing CoPilot generated response from the following prompt: \u201cProduce a guidance document for researchers that outlines issues and considerations on the topic of payments and incentives for participants. It should provide both an overview of the ethical problem and provide pragmatic solutions and tips for the researcher prior to deciding whether payment or incentive is appropriate or necessary.\u201d **Microsoft Bing CoPilot generated response from the following prompt: \u201cProvide four questions that a researcher should consider before using payments or incentives, in the form of tangible rewards (e.g. vouchers), in their research to recruit participants.\u201d \u00a9 2024 Copyright University of Gloucestershire Company Registration Number 06023243.

This is just one of the ways the University is supporting students with cost of living challenges. We are ranked in the top 20 for career prospects in the UK according to the Whatuni student Choice Awards 2023. Though we want to empower all students to create their own careers, we don\u2019t expect you to do it alone. Our professional mentoring programme matches students with a mentor who can offer invaluable insights into the world of work and build career confidence. Not all mentors will be from industries directly relevant to your course \u2013 and we think that\u2019s a good thing. Our previous mentees hugely valued the guidance of their mentors, and many had their eyes opened to whole new career possibilities. Before the programme, 46% of students who registered felt confident identifying and presenting their skills and strengths. After the programme, this percentage increased to 86% Before the programme, 31% of students who registered felt clear about the next steps on their career plan. After the programme, this went up to 82% Throughout the year we put on a number of events designed to boost your confidence and put you in touch with employers. Whether it\u2019s an informal \u2018meet the employer\u2019 drop-in at the Career Studio, or a networking event linked to your School we encourage all students to sign up and get involved.

When it comes to value for money, we prioritise offering all our students high quality teaching, helpful feedback and good learning resources so that they have the skills and opportunities to secure a good graduate job. At University of Gloucestershire, we manage our finances carefully to best look after our students and staff. As part of this we want to be open and transparent about how we spend our income, including the tuition fees paid by students, and what additional costs students may incur. Students can find more information about Your Future Plan, Skills for Study courses, UniSport activities, wellbeing services, Chaplaincy activities, sustainability projects, and any available free software, on MyGlos. Getting value for money from your tuition fees is about more than just making sure you have great academic staff to learn from. That is an important part of it, but university is a much more rounded experience. It involves having somewhere great to work and live, going on work placements and field trips, getting support to build your employability skills and career prospects, joining sports and social clubs, getting help and support in your academic and personal life, and feeling part of a real community. So your tuition fee is not just spent on providing your teaching. It is spent on everything that contributes to your whole experience at university, and all of the services and facilities that you can use. That is why we charge the same tuition fee for all undergraduate home students irrespective of what subject you are studying, because the costs we have to meet in order to provide the full range of services and facilities are not determined only by your subject of study. Tuition fees and education contracts account for the majority of our income. Teaching is our primary concern, but we're also focused on making a difference in the community. We make savings each year so that we can invest in improving facilities and building new ones.

The university spends approximately \u00a324million on works, goods and services each year. Contracts for goods and services vary from one-off purchases to periodic contracts lasting a specific time, and, there is a capital investment programme covering building schemes, computers, communications and other equipment. The university is a member of the Southern Universities Purchasing Consortium (https://www.supc.ac.uk/) (SUPC) and encourages competition from both new and established suppliers. The procurement strategy\u00a0\u200bsets out the University\u2019s mission statement, values and ethics relating to procurement and provides a number of strategic aims, objectives and actions. This will support the procurement of the goods, services and works required in a professional, sustainable and ethical manner for delivery at the right place, time, quality and cost in order to support the key organisational objective of enhancing and maximising student experience. Procurement Strategy 2020-23 (https://www.glos.ac.uk/information/knowledge-base/procurement-strategy-2020-to-2023/) From June 2016 all open opportunities to competitively tender for opportunities will be published on the\u00a0university\u2019s e-tendering portal. Visit the university\u2019s e-tendering portal (https://in-tendhost.co.uk/glos/aspx/Home) Additionally, where the estimated value of the contract is expected to exceed the financial thresholds of the Public Contracts Regulations 2015, currently \u00a3189,330 for goods and certain services, and \u00a34,733,252 for public works contracts, the requirement will be advertised in the GOV.UK Find a Tender (https://www.gov.uk/find-tender) service. The university also advertises tenders for open and competitively tendered works, goods and services valued over \u00a325,000 on the GOV.UK Contracts Finder (https://www.contractsfinder.service.gov.uk/Search) . Suppliers are able to register their interest in opportunities on the university\u2019s e-tendering portal (https://in-tendhost.co.uk/glos/aspx/Home) .\u00a0Suppliers will then receive e-mail notifications of opportunities in the categories they have expressed an interest in. Once successful at winning an opportunity suppliers will be asked to complete a supplier questionnaire.\u00a0This, along with information gathered if the opportunity was subject to a formal tender exercise or quote process, \u00a0enables us to confirm an organisation\u2019s suitability to deliver a particular service, supply or works. The information requested in the questionnaire is used to: As the cost of administering and evaluating tenders is significant, you may be required to complete a pre-qualification questionnaire to determine your company\u2019s suitability to be invited to tender. When a tender document is issued it will contain the following: Tenders will be evaluated using pre-determined criteria which are set out in the tender document. These will include criteria such as commercial awareness and the ability to meet the contract requirements. All tenderers are notified as to whether they have been successful or unsuccessful. If you wish to offer a university employee any offer, gift, favour or hospitality, there are some guidelines. In general, meals may be accepted by employees, provided they are working occasions and the cost of the hospitality is reasonable. Employee attendance at social events and occasions is acceptable where the invitation is clearly made because of the connection with the university. However, lavish hospitality should not be offered. Employees are advised not to accept hospitality from the same organisation too often or without reciprocity. For example, if there is a need for a follow up meeting or lunch, this should be provided by the university and not by the other party. All gifts or hospitality in excess of \u00a325 should be reported to the university\u2019s procurement manager and recorded in the register of interest. Where it is not possible to refuse a gift without giving offence, the gift should be accepted on behalf of the university and either surrendered to the university itself, and not kept for personal use, or bought from the university at full value. Gifts of a nominal value such as pens and stationery may be accepted.

Jump to: View residency eligibility criteria (https://www.glos.ac.uk/information/knowledge-base/sfe-residency-eligibility-criteria/) Contact the Money Advice Team (https://www.glos.ac.uk/finance/#contact) Student Loans are available for each academic year to help towards living costs and to cover the cost of the Tuition Fees. The Maintenance Loan (also known as the Loan for Living Costs) is split into 3 equal instalments and is paid directly in to the student\u2019s bank account \u2013 one instalment at the beginning of each term in each academic year. The Tuition Fee Loan is paid directly to the University. The Tuition Fee Loan is not based on household income.\u00a0The Maintenance Loan is partially based on taxable household income received in the 2022/23 tax year.\u00a0For most students aged under 25 at the start of the course it will be their parents\u2019 income that is considered for the means-test.\u00a0This could be both parents if they live in the same household; or, one parent if they live alone; or, parent and partner. Exceptions apply, see section on  Independent/Dependent (#dependent) status below.\u00a0If the student is aged 25 and over, only the partner\u2019s income (if relevant) would be considered for the means-test if both live in the same household. Please note that all eligible students would qualify for the non-means tested element of the Maintenance Loan regardless of income. This is \u00a33,790 if living in the parental home while studying and \u00a34,767 if living away from the parental home while studying (or aged 25 and over, or if assessed as Independent). Please note that if a student is employed while they study their income is not considered for the means-tested element of the Maintenance Loan.\u00a0However, unearned income will be \u2013 this includes rental income from property, investments, interest on savings, dividends, etc. Table 1: Maintenance Loan if living at the parental home while you study: Table 2: Maintenance Loan if living away from the parental home (or aged 25 and over, or if assessed as Independent) while you study: If you have previously studied at level 4 and above this may affect your eligibility\u00a0to receive funding for a new course. Student Finance use the calculation below to determine whether you are still entitled to receive funding \u2013 in particular the Tuition Fee Loan: Length in years of the new course, plus one gift year, minus number of years of previous study. This will include partial years of study. For example, if you have previously studied (at UoG or elsewhere for part of or for a full academic year the calculation will be as follows: if the new course is 3 years in length add the gift year = 4 years, minus 1 year of previous study = 3 years of full funding available for the new course. Full funding includes the Tuition Fee Loan, Maintenance Loan and Dependents\u2019 Grants (if relevant). There are exceptions to this rule and if you have previously studied at level 4 or above for more than 1 year, but had to leave the course due to medical or other personal reasons, you can apply for Compelling Personal Reasons (CPR) with Student Finance. A covering letter detailing the medical or personal reasons along with relevant evidence will need to be sent to Student Finance. We can help you with this process. To be classed as Independent, you must meet one of the following criteria at the start of the academic year. If the course starts in September 2024, you must meet the eligibility before 1 September 2024; or before 1 January 2025 if the course starts in January 2025. If Student Finance consider you to be an Independent student, your parents\u2019 income will not be considered. Instead, the means-test for the Maintenance Loan will be based on your details and the income of your partner, if relevant. If you are under 25 years of age and you have the care of a child, you will be classed as Independent. If you live with a partner, Student Finance will ask for an estimate of your partner\u2019s income as part of your application for funding. Students who are aged 60 or over on 1 September 2024 (if the course starts in September 2024) or on 1 January 2025 (if course starts in January 2025) will be eligible for a Tuition Fee Loan of \u00a39,250. This loan is not based on household income and will be paid directly to the University. A means-tested Maintenance Loan is also available if your household income is \u00a343,819 or below.\u00a0The maximum loan available is \u00a34,327. This loan is paid directly in to your bank account in 3 equal instalments per academic year \u2013 once at the beginning of each term. The Special Support Loan can increase the level of Maintenance Loan available for certain circumstances.\u00a0 This element of the Maintenance Loan will not be counted as income by the Department for Work & Pensions (DWP) when calculating entitlement to benefits. Circumstances include where the student: The Special Support Loan element is up to a maximum of \u00a34,327 and is part of the Maintenance Loan and is not a separate payment. The maximum Maintenance Loan available for students with any of the circumstances above will be \u00a310,158 for students living in the parental home while they study, and \u00a311,658 for students living away from the parental home while they study, or aged 25 and over, or if assessed as Independent by Student Finance. Please note that if your course has a placement year the Tuition Fee will be \u00a31,500.\u00a0 You will be able to apply for a Tuition Fee Loan from Student Finance for a placement year but please note that the Maintenance Loan entitlement is at a reduced rate and will not be based on household income. This will be \u00a32,324 if living at parental home and \u00a33,098 if living away from the parental home, or aged 25 and over, or if assessed as Independent. Exceptions will apply so please do contact us for more information if you feel that this may apply to you. If your academic year is longer than the standard 30 weeks and 3 days, and you are entitled to the means-tested element of the Maintenance Loan, you will be considered for the Long Courses Loan. This means you may be entitled to an additional \u00a373 per additional week of the course if you are living in the parental home, and \u00a3110 per additional week if you are living away from the parental home, or aged 25 and over, or assessed as Independent by Student Finance. If your household income reduces by at least 15% in 2024/25 tax year from household income in 2022/23 tax year your finance application can be reassessed by Student Finance based on estimated household income for the 2024/25 tax year. This may entitle you to a higher rate of Maintenance Loan and even Dependants\u2019 Grants if relevant.\u00a0The reduction in household income could be for a number of reasons: Redundancy, parents have separated, Estranged from parents etc. Household income for 2022/23 must be submitted to Student Finance in the first instance.\u00a0Following this a Current Year Income Form must be completed providing the estimated household income for the 2024/25 tax year.\u00a0We offer a Check and Send service.\u00a0We can send the form out to you, check it and post it to Student Finance on your behalf. From April/May 2024 current year income details can also uploaded via the students\u2019 online account with Student Finance.  Before you can apply for the Grants for Dependants, which are non-repayable, you have to submit the main student loan application to Student Finance England, even if you don\u2019t want to apply for student loans.

This grant will be paid directly to the childcare provider by a third party \u2013 the Childcare Grant Payment Service (CCGPS).\u00a0You will need to register with this service when Student Finance has assessed your application.\u00a0Please note: this grant is not considered for benefits purposes. You will not be eligible for the Childcare Grant if you are expecting to receive the Childcare Element of Working Tax Credit or Universal Credit, or tax-free Childcare from HMRC. Check with your local council for information on childcare outside of school hours, including breakfast clubs, homework clubs and after-school clubs.

To contact the Disability Team , email disability@glos.ac.uk (mailto:disability@glos.ac.uk) or phone 01242 714541. To contact the Mental Health & Wellbeing Team , email mhw@glos.ac.uk (mailto:mhw@glos.ac.uk) or phone 01242 714542. You need to apply every year from March on the GOV.UK student finance webpage (http://www.gov.uk/studentfinance)  (no need to wait for confirmation of a place on a course). If you would prefer to apply on the paper application, we can help.\u00a0We offer a Check and Send service. We can send you the application forms to complete and then return to us for checking and posting on to Student Finance. Loans will be repayable in the April following graduation but only if you are earning a gross salary above \u00a325,000 per year.\u00a0Your monthly loan repayment will be calculated on 9% of earnings above the gross income threshold of \u00a325,000 which is \u00a32,083 per month.\u00a0For example, a graduate with an annual gross salary of \u00a326,000 earns \u00a32,166 per month which is \u00a383 above the repayment threshold. So, 9% of \u00a383 = \u00a37.47. This will be your monthly repayment regardless of the size of your student loan debt. If you are employed, a deduction will automatically be taken from your monthly salary, via your National Insurance Contributions. If you are self-employed, repayment will be arranged when you complete your self-assessment. Please note that interest begins to accrue as soon as you receive the first instalment of the Maintenance Loan, or when the first instalment of the Tuition Fee Loan is paid to the university. Interest will continue to accrue until the loan is repaid in full or has been written off. The interest rate is in line with the Retail Price Index (RPI).\u00a0RPI is a measure of inflation.\u00a0The interest is calculated daily and then applied to your balance of loan each month. Balance of loans that remain outstanding after 40 years will be written off. Once enrolled each year you can apply to the university\u2019s Financial Assistance Fund for help towards paying for field trips; accommodation, general living costs etc. Applications are means-tested on your personal circumstances so awards cannot be guaranteed from this source, but it is worth applying as awards do not have to be repaid.\u00a0Apply online via your Student Record on the MyGlos app from the start of your course. This will depend upon the type of Halls you will be staying in. For more information about halls and other housing options, please visit the halls of residence rent for 2024/25 webpage (https://www.glos.ac.uk/information/knowledge-base/halls-of-residence-rent-2024-25/) . This will depend on the individuals\u2019 circumstances so an exact figure cannot be given.\u00a0Learning how to budget is crucial and we can help you to stay on top of your finances during your studies by helping you to create and stick to a budget. Please contact us (#contact-us) for more information. Students on full-time courses are exempt from paying Council Tax. Once enrolled you will be able to access a Council Tax Exemption Certificate from your Student Record online.\u00a0You will need to send this to the relevant Council. If you live with one adult who is not a student on a full-time course, they will qualify for the 25% Single Occupancy Discount. No exemption will apply if you live with more than one adult who is not a student on a full-time. Most students will not be able to access Universal Credit.\u00a0However, there are exceptions.\u00a0For more information please contact us (#contact-us) .

Or perhaps a leisurely swim at Cheltenham\u2019s Lido (50m outdoor pool) is more your thing. There are many links between Gloucestershire and the Harry Potter books and films. Not only are the Potters supposedly from this county and the Dursleys are named after a local village, but many iconic scenes were filmed here too.
